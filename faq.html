      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <h3>What is FotoSort?</h3>
      <p>FotoSort is a tool that sorts a collection of motorcycle trackday photos by rider.</p>

      <h3>How does FotoSort work?</h3>
      <p>After uploading a folder of photos, our proprietary algorithms analyze and group all motorcycles/riders that are found, regardless of angle or viewing perspective (e.g. front, back, side). After processing, the automatic groupings can be refined with our interactive user interface.
      <p>A Windows or macOS script is then generated to organize the original photos on your device based on the final groupings, which creates a unique folder for each rider and copies each photo to its appropriate folder.</p>

      <h3>Why use FotoSort?</h3>
      <p><strong>Simplify photo browsing:</strong> Allow customers to easily find their photos without the hassle of sifting through thousands of images.</p>
      <p><strong>Increase sales potential:</strong> Improve visibility for photos that customers are interested in purchasing.</p>
      <p><strong>Save time and reduce turnaround:</strong> Eliminate hours of manual photo sorting, reducing the time until customers can view their photos.</p>

      <h3>Are photos uploaded to FotoSort secure?</h3>
      <p>Yes. All uploaded photos are encrypted and authentication is required to access them.</p>
      <p><u>We will never share or distribute your photos.</u></p>

      <h3>Can FotoSort handle large volumes of photos?</h3>
      <p>FotoSort is designed to process up to 5,000 photos per session.</p>
      <p>However, if possible, we recommend breaking up sessions in manageable chunks of 50-80 unique riders for the best experience.</p>
      <p>This can be done by splitting photo sets by rider session (e.g. Advanced/Intermediate/Novice) before upload, if applicable.</p>

      <h3>How long does processing take?</h3>
      <p>Sessions containing up to 1,000 photos are usually processed within 20 minutes after upload.</p>
      <p>Excess photos are processed at an approximate rate of 15 minutes per 1,000 photos.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to keep the FotoSort application open while sessions are processing?</h3>
      <p>No. After a session is uploaded, processing is done on our secure servers. You may exit the application and return at a later time.</p>

      <h3>Can I upload new sessions while previous sessions are still processing?</h3>
      <p>Yes, new sessions can be created at any time, even when older sessions are still processing.</p>
      <p>Multiple sessions can also be uploaded at the same time (in parallel) using multiple browser tabs or windows.</p>

      <h3>Should I resize my photos before uploading them?</h3>
      <p>No, the FotoSort platform automatically resizes your photos to a size appropriate for uploading and processing.</p>

      <h3>How does FotoSort handle the same person riding multiple motorcycles, or multiple people riding one motorcycle?</h3>
      <p>Our advanced algorithms consider the visual similarity of both motorcycles and their riders at the pixel level.</p>
      <p>Automatic groupings can be easily refined on our interactive user interface to meet your grouping preferences.</p>

      <h3>System Requirements</h3>
      <p>FotoSort is compatible with modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.</p>
      <p>Photos must be uploaded from a Windows, macOS, or Linux device with permissions to run Command Prompt or Shell scripts.
      <p>An internet connection with at least 2 Mbps upload speed per 1,000 photos is recommended.</p>
